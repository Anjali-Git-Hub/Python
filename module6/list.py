# list is an ordered collection of data 
# lists are mutable
# we can store any type of data in lists 
# declare a list  by using [square brackets]

numbers=[2,3,4,5,6]
# print (numbers)
# print(type(numbers)) # through type function we can check whether it is a list or not or any other type like int , float, string,tuple etc

names=["mohan","rohan","alu","kachalu"]
# print(names)

mixed=["apple","mango",24,'a',None] #none is a special type of value that means nothing 
# print(mixed)




# we can do slicing in list

# print(mixed[::-1])
# print(mixed[0:2])
# print(numbers[0::2])



# change the data of list
# mixed[1]="banana"
# print(mixed)
