# we can concatenate a string with string only not with a number !!
# name="anja"
# last_name="li"
# print(name+last_name);


# name="anjali"
# age=18
# print(name+age)
# error string concatenate number is wrong

# so convert this number into string by si ply adding "18" or str()func.
# name="anjali"
# age="18"  
# print(name+age)

#  or

name="anjali"
# age="18"  
# print(name+str(age))
# to add the space between them we can concatenate an empty strig between name and age 
# print(name+" "+str(age))


#  we can use * sign with strings
print(name*3)
# it will print the name 3 times
